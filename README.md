# Bamazon

The bamazonCustomer.js App is like an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Node.js.  The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

The second part bamazonManger.js:

 List a set of menu options:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
